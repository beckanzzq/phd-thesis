This thesis proposes conceptually new ways to realize materials with topological properties by
using dipole-dipole interactions. First, we study a system of ultracold dipolar fermions, where
the relaxation mechanism of dipolar spins can be used to reach the quantum Hall regime. Second, in
a system of polar molecules in an optical lattice, dipole-dipole interactions induce spin-orbit
coupling terms for the rotational excitations. In combination with time-reversal symmetry breaking
this leads to topological bands with Chern numbers greater than one.
