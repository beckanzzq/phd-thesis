\chapter{Realizing dipolar spin models}
\label{dipolar_spinmodels}

This introductory chapter is largely of technical nature and describes the detailed steps for
the realization of dipolar spin systems. Starting from the microscopic setup, the goal is to
introduce a common framework for the derivation of the effective models which are subject of
\cref{anomalous_behavior,dipolar_fermions,topological_bands} of this thesis. For this purpose,
we will introduce three kinds of physical systems which can be used to realize dipolar spin
models: dipolar atoms, polar molecules and Rydberg atoms.

The next step is to understand the structure of the dipole-dipole interaction itself.
It comes in two different types, although both of them are usually present at the same time.
The \emph{static} dipole-dipole interaction has been of great interest and importance in ultracold systems from the beginning~\cite{Goral1999,Santos2000a,Santos2003a,Griesmaier2005a,Stuhler2005,Ronen2007a,Koch2008a,Lahaye2008a,Lahaye2009}.
In dipolar spin systems, it can be used to engineer Ising-type spin interactions~\cite{Micheli2006,Hauke2010,Gorshkov2011,Gorshkov2011b,Peter2012b,Syzranov2014,Peter2014}.
In this thesis, we are mostly going to focus on the second type: dipolar \emph{exchange} interactions.
Here, the internal state of the dipolar particles can change~\cite{Huber2011,Yan2013,DePaz2013,Hazzard2014,Barredo2014,Syzranov2014}.
The exchange interactions can be subdivided according to their angular momentum characteristic.
One sector preserves the internal and external angular momentum separately.
In \cref{anomalous_behavior}, this will be used to simulate $XY$-type spin interactions.
The second sector only conserves the sum of internal and external angular momentum.
This type of interaction induces a spin-orbit coupling which plays an essential part in \cref{dipolar_fermions,topological_bands} where the coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom will be used in different ways.

\section{Physical implementations of dipolar systems}

In this section we briefly review some of the possible realizations for dipolar spin
systems in ultracold atomic and molecular systems and discuss some of the similarities
as well as important differences. A detailed review on dipolar systems can be found in
\refcite{Lahaye2009}. Other systems can also be used to simulate dipolar spin models, but are not detailed here. Those include trapped ions setups~\cite{Britton2012,Kim2010}, nuclear spins on diamond surfaces~\cite{Cai2012} or optical lattice clocks~\cite{Martin2013}.

\subsection{Atoms with high magnetic moments}

Highly dipolar atoms where among the first experimental realizations of ultracold dipolar
systems~\cite{Griesmaier2005a}. These atoms have large magnetic dipole moments due to their
particular electronic structure. In the recent years, a large number of different dipolar atoms
have been successfully cooled. Chromium with a magnetic moment of $6\muB$ is successfully
used in experiments in both bosonic~\cite{Griesmaier2005a,Beaufils2008} and fermionic
forms~\cite{Naylor2015}. Dysprosium with a magnetic moment of $10\muB$ is the atom with the largest
dipole moment. Again, both bosonic~\cite{Lu2011} and fermionic~\cite{Lu2012} quantum degenerate
gases have been demonstrated. The same is true for Erbium with a magnetic moment of $7\muB$, where
bosonic~\cite{Aikawa2012} and fermionic isotopes~\cite{Aikawa2014} have been cooled to quantum
degeneracy.

In their electronic ground state, these atoms typically posses a large amount of internal hyperfine
states which contribute to a rich internal structure that can be controlled via Zeeman shifts
and optical pumping techniques. Compared to polar molecules, magnetic atoms have a permanent
dipole moment, even at zero field. This is useful for certain applications which involve dipolar
relaxation such as demagnetization cooling~\cite{Hensler2003,Fattori2006,Volchkov2013}. Other
advantages compared to polar molecules are the generally easier structure which makes them easier
to cool and manipulate as well as the absence of chemical reactions present in polar
molecules~\cite{Ospelkaus2010a,Quemener2012}.

\subsection{Polar molecules}

The dipolar effects in polar molecules can be much larger due to the
electric nature of the dipole moments which typically leads to an interaction strength which
is stronger by up to four orders of magnitude due to the $\alpha^2$ factor between electric
and magnetic systems. For a detailed comparison of the different interaction strengths,
see~\cite{Lahaye2009}. Different species of polar molecules have been successfully cooled, among
them KRb~\cite{Ni2008b,Ospelkaus2010}, NaK~\cite{Wu2012a} and NaLi~\cite{Heo2012}. For a review,
see~\cite{Quemener2012}.

In this thesis, we focus on the rotational structure of the polar molecules,
neglecting any vibrational and electronic excitations, as well as possible hyperfine structure
effects. Then, the internal structure of the molecules is given by the rotational degree
of freedom. Describing the molecule as a rigid rotor, the internal structure is given by
$H_\text{rot}=B J^2 - \vecd \vec{E}$, where $B$ is the rotational constant and $\vecd$ is the
dipole moment which couples to an external electric field $\vec{E}$. In the absence of any external
fields, the eigenstates are simply given by the angular momentum states $\ket{J,M}$ where $J$ is
the total angular momentum and $M=-J, \dots, J$ is the projection onto the quantization axis.

In contrast to magnetic atoms, polar molecules do not have a dipole moment in the absence of
external fields, that is $\smallbraketop{J,M}{\vecd}{J,M}=0$ for any $J, M$. An external electric
field, however, mixes states with different $J$ and induces static dipole moments (which are
constrained by the permanent electric dipole moment $d$ of the molecules). Another important
difference compared to magnetic atoms is the rotational splitting $B$ which is typically much
larger than the dipolar interaction strength $\kappa d^2/a^3$ between two molecules at realistic
inter-molecule separations $a$, although this can be circumvented~\cite{Klinsmann2014}.

Just like atoms, polar molecules can be trapped in optical lattices~\cite{Chotia2012}. The
experimentally achievable fillings are, so far, much smaller than for atoms. Nevertheless,
long-range dipolar effects have been observed in optical lattices, demonstrating one of the
fundamental building blocks for dipolar spin models~\cite{Yan2013}.

\subsection{Rydberg atoms}

While we mostly focus on polar molecules in this thesis, the physics and energy scales in highly
excited Rydberg atoms can be very similar to polar molecules~\cite{Low2012}. Dipolar effects have
been observed in Rydberg atoms~\cite{Westermann2006,Nipper2012b,Barredo2014,Ravets2015} and the
achievable dipole moments can be even larger than for polar molecules~\cite{Booth2014}. While
the internal structure can be more complicated due to the fine structure, precise control through
electric and magnetic fields still allows to select a suitable set of internal states for the
realization of spin systems~\cite{Barredo2014,Weber2015}.

\section{Dipole-dipole interaction}
The aim of this section is to rewrite the familiar interaction between two dipoles $\vec{d}_i$ and $\vec{d}_j$ at positions $\vecR_i, \vecR_j$, namely
\begin{align} \tlabel{ddint}
\Hdd_{ij} = \frac{\kappa}{\absv{\vecR_{ij}}^3} \bc{ \vecd_i \cdot \vecd_j -3 \bb{ \vecd_i \cdot \hat{\vecR}_{ij} }\bb{ \vecd_j \cdot \hat{\vecR}_{ij} } }
\end{align}
in a spherical tensor representation~\cite{Micheli2007,Gorshkov2011c} which will be useful throughout this thesis.
\Tref{ddint} is given in terms of the relative vector $\vecR_{ij} = \vecR_j - \vecR_i$ and its normalized form $\hat{\vecR}_{ij}$.
The constant prefactor is given by $\kappa = 1/4\pi\epsilon$ for electric dipoles and by
$\kappa = \mu_0 / 4\pi$ for magnetic dipoles.
In the following, we focus on the distance-independent part $D_{ij} \equiv \Hdd_{ij} \cdot \absv{\vecR_{ij}}^3/\kappa=\vecd_i \cdot \vecd_j -3 (\vecd_i \cdot \hat{\vecR}_{ij})(\vecd_j \cdot \hat{\vecR}_{ij})$ of the dipole-dipole interaction which can be written in terms of the spherical tensor $T^2(\vecd_i, \vecd_j)$ of rank two with the components
\begin{align}
T^2_0(\vecd^i, \vecd^j) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} (d_i^+ d_j^- + 2d_i^0 d_j^0 + d_i^{-} d_j^{+}), \\
T^2_{\pm 1}(\vecd^i, \vecd^j) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (d_i^{\pm} d_j^0 + d_i^0 d_j^{\pm}), \\
T^2_{\pm 2}(\vecd^i, \vecd^j) &= d_i^{\pm} d_j^{\pm} \vphantom{\frac{1}{42}}.
\end{align}
It is constructed from the two dipole moments which are themselves rank-one tensors with spherical components
\begin{align} \tlabel{sphericalcomp}
d^0_i = d^z_i, \qquad d_i^\pm = \mp\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bb{d_i^x\pm i d_i^y}.
\end{align}
Using this, the dipole-dipole interaction can be written as a contraction of two rank-two tensors~\cite{Brown2003}, leading to
\begin{align}
    D_{ij} &= -\sqrt{6} \: T^2(C)\cdot T^2(\vec{d_1},\vec{d_2})\\
           &= -\sqrt{6}  \sum_{m=-2}^{2} (-1)^m C^2_{-m}(\theta,\phi) \, T^2_m(\vecd_i,\vecd_j).
\end{align}
Here, $C^l_m(\theta,\phi)=\sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2l+1}} Y^l_m(\theta,\phi)$ are the modified (unnormalized) spherical harmonics and the spherical angles $\theta = \theta_{ij}$ and $\phi = \phi_{ij}$ describe the direction of the vector $\hat{\vecR}_{ij}$ in the coordinate system of the quantization axis. We can expand this expression to get
\begin{align}\tlabel{doperator}
    D_{ij} &= (1-3\cos^2 \theta) \BC{ d_i^0 d_j^0 + \frac{1}{2}\Bb{d_i^+ d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^+} } \\
           &\quad -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\theta \,\cos\theta\, \BC{ \Bb{ d_i^0 d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^0 } \ef{+i\phi} - \Bb{ d_i^0 d_j^+ + d_i^+ d_j^0 } \ef{-i\phi} } \\
           &\quad -\frac{3}{2}\sin^2\theta \, \BC{ \ef{+2i\phi} d_i^- d_j^- + \ef{-2i\phi} d_i^+ d_j^+ }.
\end{align}
It is worth noting that the $T^2_{m=0}(\vecd_i, \vecd_j)$-terms in the first row conserve the ``internal'' angular momentum while the $m=1$ ($m=2$) terms in the second (third) row increase or decrease the internal angular momentum by one (two) quanta.

\subsection{High-symmetry alignments}
For most applications, we will be concerned with two-dimensional systems where the dipoles are aligned perpendicular to the plane. Then, the dipoles are also perpendicular to the interconnecting axis $\vecR_{ij}$, implying $\theta = \pi/2$. In this case, the $m=1$ terms drop out and the tensorial part reduces to
\begin{align} \tlabel{dop2d}
    D^\text{(2D)}_{ij} = d_i^0 d_j^0 + \frac{1}{2}\bb{d_i^+ d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^+} -\frac{3}{2} \bb{ d_i^- d_j^- \ef{+2i\phi} + d_i^+ d_j^+ \ef{-2i\phi} }
\end{align}
For a one-dimensional geometry there are two high-symmetry alignments. If the dipoles are perpendicular to the lattice direction (say, the $x$-direction) we can set $\phi=0$, further simplifying $D_{ij}$ to
\begin{align}
    D_{ij}^{(1D,\perp)} &= d_i^0 d_j^0 + \frac{1}{2}\bb{d_i^+ d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^+} -\frac{3}{2} \bb{d_i^- d_j^- + d_i^+ d_j^+} \\
 &= d_i^z d_j^z + d_i^y d_j^y - 2 d_i^x d_j^x.
\end{align}
Conversely, if the dipoles point along the lattice direction, we can set $\theta=0$ in \tref{doperator} to get
\begin{align}
    D^{(1D,\parallel)}_{ij} &= -2 d_i^0 d_j^0 - \bb{d_i^+ d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^+} = -2 d_i^z d_j^z+ d_i^x d_j^x + d_i^y d_j^y
\end{align}

\subsection{Tilted field geometry}
\doublefig{.4}{lattice-geometry}{Tilted-field 2D geometry}
{.4}{dipole-moments}{Schematic level structure}
{\sfA~Illustration of the relevant axes and angles. The lattice lies in the $xy$ plane while the static external field $\vec{E}$ is tilted from the $z$ axis by an angle $\Theta_0$ and rotated around it by an angle $\Phi_0$ with respect to the $x$ axis. The direction of the vector $\vec{R}$, connecting two dipoles, is determined by the polar angle $\Phi$.
\sfB~Internal rotational states of a dipole with a ground state $\ketz$ and excited state $\keto$ with $M=0$, as well as two states $\ketpm$ with $M=\pm 1$. The relevant static dipole moments (blue) and transition dipole moments (red) are shown. The plus sign is for the transitions going \qu{upwards} and the minus sign for transitions going \qu{downwards}.}


If we are not in a high-symmetry geometry, we can consider a more general situation (see \tref{lattice-geometry}) with a two-dimensional system in the $xy$ plane and an external polarizing field $\vec{E}$ pointing in an arbitrary direction~\cite{Gorshkov2011c}, determined by the spherical angles $\Theta_0$ and $\Phi_0$:
\begin{align}
    \vec{\hat{E}}=\begin{pmatrix}
        \sin\Theta_0\cos\Phi_0 \\
        \sin\Theta_0\sin\Phi_0 \\
        \cos\Theta_0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
As before, we are interested in the interaction between two dipoles which are now separated
by the in-plane vector
\begin{align}
\vecR_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}R_{ij} \cos\phi_{ij} \\ R_{ij} \sin\phi_{ij} \\ 0\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
For the angle $\theta$ between the dipole orientation $\vec{\hat{E}}$ and the interconnection line between the dipoles $\hat{\vecR}_{ij}$, we find the relation
\begin{align}
    \cos\theta = \vec{\hat{E}} \cdot \hat{\vecR}_{ij} &= \sin\Theta_0\bb{\cos\Phi_0\cos\phi_{ij}+\sin\Phi_0\sin\phi_{ij}}\\
                                                      &=\sin\Theta_0\cos(\phi_{ij}-\Phi_0).
\end{align}
By defining the difference $\bar\Phi=\phi_{ij}-\Phi_0$, we can express the relevant terms in the dipole-dipole interaction from \tref{doperator} as
\begin{align} \tlabel{fmfunctions}
    f_0(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi)&\equiv 1-3\cos^2\theta = 1-3\sin^2\Theta_0\cos^2\bar\Phi, \vphantom{\bb{\bar \Phi}} \\
    f_1(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi)&\equiv \sin\theta\cos\theta \ef{i\phi} = \sin\Theta_0 \cos\bar\Phi \bb{\cos\Theta_0 \cos\bar\Phi + i \sin \bar\Phi}, \\
    f_2(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi)&\equiv\sin^2\theta \ef{2i\phi} = \bb{\cos\Theta_0 \cos\bar\Phi + i \sin \bar\Phi}^2.
\end{align}
Those are easily seen to reduce to the expressions \labeltref{dop2d} in the case of a perpendicular external field with $\Theta_0=0$, implying $\theta=\pi/2$ and $\bar\Phi=\phi_{ij}$.
In total, the tensorial part of the dipole-dipole interaction is given by
\begin{align} \tlabel{tensortilted}
    D_{ij} = f_0(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) &\BC{ d_i^0 d_j^0 + \frac{1}{2}\bb{d_i^+ d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^+} } \\
    \qquad-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} &\BC{ f_1(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi)  (d_i^0 d_j^- + d_i^- d_j^0) - f_1(\Theta_0, -\bar \Phi) (d_i^0 d_j^+ + d_i^+ d_j^0) }\\
    \qquad-\frac{3}{2} &\BC{ f_2(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) d_i^- d_j^- + f_2(\Theta_0, -\bar \Phi) d_i^+ d_j^+ }.
\end{align}
% The dipole-dipole interaction is symmetric under spatial inversion, implying:
% \begin{align}
%     f_m(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi + \pi) = f_m(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi).
% \end{align}
% Under complex conjugation, we find
% \begin{align}
%     f_m^*(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) = f_m(\Theta_0, -\bar \Phi)
% \end{align}
% In addition, we can write
% \begin{align}
%     f_1(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) = \frac{1}{2} \sin \Theta_0 \bc{\cos \Theta_0 (1+\cos 2\bar \Phi) + i \sin 2 \bar \Phi}
% \end{align}
% For small angles $\Theta_0$, we can rewrite
% \begin{align}
%     f_0(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) &= 1 \\
%     f_1(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) &= \frac{1}{2} \Theta_0 \bc{1+\ef{2 i \bar \Phi}}=\Theta_0 \cos \bar \Phi \ef{i \bar \Phi}\\
%     f_2(\Theta_0, \bar \Phi) &= \ef{2 i \bar \Phi}
% \end{align}
% Defining $\Theta_0^* = \pi/2 - \theta_\text{magic}=\text{asin}(1/\sqrt{3})$, we have
% \begin{align}
%     f_0(\Theta_0^*, \bar \Phi) = 1-\cos^2\bar \Phi
% \end{align}

% \paragraph{In-plane field:}
% For $\Theta_0=\pi/2$, the expressions above reduce to
% \begin{align}
%     1-3\cos^2\theta &= 1-3\cos^2\bar\Phi \\
%     \sin\theta\cos\theta \ef{\pm i\phi} &= \pm \frac{i}{2} \sin 2\bar\Phi \\
%     \sin^2\theta \ef{\pm 2i\phi} &= - \sin^2 \bar\Phi
% \end{align}

% \paragraph{One-dimensional setup:}
% For a 1D setup we can set $\Phi_0=0$. The angle $\Phi$ is limited
% to the values $0$ or $\pi$, indicated by $\sin\Phi=0$ and
% $\cos\Phi=\pm 1=\text{sign}(X)$. Then, the expressions above reduce to
% \begin{align}
%     1-3\cos^2\theta &= 1-3\sin^2\Theta_0 \\
%     \sin\theta\cos\theta \ef{\pm i\phi} &= \sin\Theta_0 \cos\Theta_0 \\
%     \sin^2\theta \ef{\pm 2i\phi} &= \cos^2 \Theta_0
% \end{align}


\section{Dipolar spin models}
The different dipolar models throughout this thesis will be largely determined by a particular choice of internal states of the dipoles. These states can be additionally \qu{dressed} by external DC and AC fields, with the details depending on the particular physical realization.
In the following, we look at several specific choices. Each of them corresponds to a rise in complexity compared to the previous one, but also introduces additional properties and characteristics.

\subsection{Realizing Ising and XY interactions}
\tlabel{xxz}
Here, we assume that we have chosen two states, denoted as $\ketz$ and $\keto$, which have the
same $M$ quantum number (see~\tref{dipole-moments}).
Then, only the $d^0_id^0_j$ part of the dipolar interaction is relevant.
We define the (transition) dipole elements
\begin{align}
    d_0 = \smallbraketop{0}{d^0}{0},\qquad
    d_1 = \smallbraketop{1}{d^0}{1},\qquad
    q_1 = |\smallbraketop{1}{d^0}{0}| = |\smallbraketop{0}{d^0}{1}|.
\end{align}
The evaluation of these dipole matrix elements for polar molecules in the presence of external fields is straightforward and has been described in detail elsewhere~\cite{Micheli2007}.
Using the projectors $P^0 = \ketbra{0}{0}$ and $P^1 = \ketbra{1}{1}$, we can now express the
dipole-dipole interaction \labeltref{dop2d} in the $\ketz, \keto$ subspace as
\begin{align}
    \Hdd_{ij} = \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} \Big[ d_1^2 P^1_i P^1_j + d_0^2 P^0_i P^0_j &+ d_1d_0 (P^1_i P^0_j + P^0_i P^1_j) \\
              &+ q_1^2 (\splus_i \sminus_j + \sminus_i \splus_j) \Big]
\end{align}
where we have neglected all processes which are not energy-conserving,
i.e. terms that do not conserve the number of excitations.
Using $\sz = P^1 - P^0$ and $\id = P^1 + P^0$ we find
\begin{align} \tlabel{xyfull}
    \Hdd_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} \Big[ \frac{(d_1-d_0)^2}{4} \sz_i \sz_j  + q_1^2 (\splus_i \sminus_j + \sminus_i \splus_j)\\
              &\qquad\qquad + \frac{d_1^2 - d_0^2}{4} (\sz_i + \sz_j)  + \frac{(d_1+d_0)^2}{4} \Big].
\end{align}
Here, the first two terms describe Ising- and XY-type interactions between the two-level dipoles. The third term is equivalent to a magnetic field in $z$ direction and the last term is a constant energy offset. Typically, we will be interested in the interaction terms in the first line. Note, however, that the \qu{magnetic field} term and the constant offset depend on the positions of all other dipoles. If the system is not translationally invariant, these terms
describe spatially dependent contributions.

\paragraph{Dipolar XXZ Hamiltonian:}
Using the spin one-half operators $S^\alpha_i = \hbar \sigma^\alpha_i/2$, we can write the interaction Hamiltonian for a system of interacting dipoles as
\begin{align} \tlabel{hxxz}
    H &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i\ne j} \Hdd_{ij} = \sum_{i\ne j} \frac{\kappa}{\hbar^2 R_{ij}^3} \Big[ \frac{(d_1-d_0)^2}{2} S^z_i S^z_j  + q_1^2 (S^x_i S^x_j + S^y_i S^y_j) \Big] \\
         % &= \sum_{i\ne j} \frac{a^3}{R_{ij}^3} \Big[ \frac{\kappa (d_1-d_0)^2}{2a^3} S^z_i S^z_j  + \frac{\kappa q_1^2}{a^3} (S^x_i S^x_j + S^y_i S^y_j) \Big] \\
         &= \frac{Ja^3}{\hbar^2} \sum_{i\ne j} \frac{\cos\theta\, S^z_i S^z_j  + \sin\theta\, (S^x_i S^x_j + S^y_i S^y_j)}{R_{ij}^3}
\end{align}
where we have introduced $J\cos\theta = \kappa (d_1-d_0)^2/2a^3$ and $J\sin\theta = \kappa q_1^2/a^3$ for a convenient parametrization.
The length $a$ (lattice constant) has been introduced to define an energy scale $J$, which will be useful for future applications.
This model is reminiscent of the famous XXZ Hamiltonian, where the nearest neighbor interactions are replaced by the dipolar $R_{ij}^{-3}$ interaction. For particular values of the $\theta$ parameter, this model describes an Ising model ($\theta = 0, \pi$), Heisenberg model ($\theta=\pm \pi/2$) or XY model ($\theta=\pi/4, 3\pi/4$). The modifications due to the dipolar interaction are subject of \cref{anomalous_behavior} of this thesis.

\paragraph{Angular momentum difference:}
Staying in the regime of two-level dipoles, we can reach a different but related situation, if the upper state $\keto$ is replaced by the $M=1$ state $\ketp$, see \tref{dipole-moments}.
Proceeding similarly as before, we define the relevant dipole matrix elements
\begin{align}
    d_0 = \smallbraketop{0}{d^0}{0},\quad
    d_+ = \smallbraketop{+}{d^0}{+},\quad
    q_+ = |\smallbraketop{+}{d^+}{0}| = |\smallbraketop{0}{d^-}{+}|.
\end{align}
Note that we can choose the phases of $\ketz$ and $\ketp$ freely, allowing us to choose real values for the transition dipole elements. Be aware, however, that $\smallbraketop{0}{d^-}{+} = \smallbraketop{+}{(d^-)^\dag}{0}^* = -\smallbraketop{+}{d^+}{0}^*$ due to the definition of $d^\pm$.
In contrast to the previous section, the term $d^0_i d^0_j$ only generates an interaction term proportional to $\sz_i \sz_j$, as the angular momentum of the two states is different. However, the term $d^+_i d^-_j$ in the dipole-dipole interaction provides an excitation-conserving tunneling term proportional to $\splus\sminus$, just as before. The different nature of the states leads to a flipped sign compared to the previous model:
\begin{align} \tlabel{hddzp}
    \Hdd_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} \Big[ \frac{(d_+-d_0)^2}{4} \sz_i \sz_j  - \frac{q_+^2}{2} (\splus_i \sminus_j + \sminus_i \splus_j) \\
              &\qquad\qquad\qquad + \frac{d_+^2 - d_0^2}{4} (\sz_i + \sz_j)  + \frac{(d_++d_0)^2}{4} \Big].
\end{align}
This allows us to tune the model in \tref{hxxz} to different $\theta$ values.

\paragraph{Magnetic dipoles:}
As an immediate application of \tref{hddzp}, we consider spin $S=1/2$ atoms with a
magnetic dipole moment $\vec{d}=\muB g \vecsigma / 2$.
Then, the dipole matrix elements are given by
\begin{align}
    d_0 &= \smallbraketop{0}{d^0}{0} = -\muB g/2, \vphantom{\sqrt{2}} \\
    d_+ &= \smallbraketop{+}{d^0}{+} = +\muB g/2, \vphantom{\sqrt{2}} \\
    q_+ &= |\smallbraketop{+}{d^+}{0}| = \smallbraketop{+}{\sqrt{2} \sigma^+}{0} = +\muB g/\sqrt{2}.
\end{align}
Including the energy non-conserving terms proportional to $\sminus_i\sminus_j$, the Hamiltonian reduces to
\begin{align} \tlabel{hdd2dmagnetic}
    \Hdd_{ij} = \frac{\kappa \muB^2 g^2}{4 R_{ij}^3} \bc{ \sz_i \sz_j - \bb{\splus_i \sminus_j+ 3 \sminus_i\sminus_j \ef{+2i\phi} + \hc } }.
\end{align}
This type of interaction between two magnetic dipoles will be utilized in~\cref{dipolar_fermions}, where we make use of the dipolar relaxation terms.


\subsection{Excitation hopping: mapping to hard-core bosons}
It is often useful to think about spin models in terms of excitations above a certain well defined (ground) state~\cite{Holstein1940}.
As an exemplary case, we take the spin $1/2$ model from \tref{hxxz} and write it in terms of
$S^\pm =S ^x_i\pm iS^y_i$:
\begin{align}
    H &= \frac{Ja^3}{\hbar^2} \sum_{i\ne j}  \frac{1}{R_{ij}^3} \bc{ \cos\theta\, S^z_i S^z_j  + \frac{1}{2}\sin\theta\, (S^+_i S^-_j + S^-_i S^+_j) }.
\end{align}
Assume that, for some set of parameters, the system is in the state $\ket{G}=\prod_i \ketdn_i$ and we are interested in the excitations.
Then, for each site, we can introduce the operator $\bop_i=S^-_i/\hbar = \ketbra{\downarrow}{\uparrow}_i$ as well as its adjoint $\bopd_i=S^+_i/\hbar$.
It is easy to see that they satisfy the commutation relation $\smash{[\bop_i, \bopd_j]}=(1 - 2 \nop_i) \delta_{ij}$, where $\nop_i = \smash{\bopd_i \bop_i} = S^z_i/\hbar + 1/2$.
For $i\ne j$, these are just bosonic commutation relations.
However, on a single site, we find $\bop_i \bop_i = \smash{\bopd_i \bopd_i} = 0$ and $\smash{\{\bop_i, \bopd_i\}=1}$.
When interpreting $\bopd_i$ as the creation of a single particle (excitation) at site $i$, these equations formalize the so-called hard core constraint: only a single excitation can be present at each site.
Keeping the constraint in mind, we can treat these operators as bosonic creation and annihilation operators for single excitations above the vacuum $\ket{G}$ with $\bop_i\ket{G}=0$ and write the model as
\begin{align}
    H &= J \sum_{i\ne j}  \frac{a^3}{R_{ij}^3} \bc{ \cos\theta\, \nop_i \nop_j  + \frac{1}{2}\sin\theta \bb{\bopd_i\bop_j + \bop_i\bopd_j} }.
\end{align}
For a detailed treatment, see \cref{anomalous_behavior} and \cref{spinwave_analysis}. In the following, we will extend this idea to dipoles with more than two internal states.

\subsection{Three-level dipoles: appearance of spin-orbit coupling}
\tlabel{threelevel}
First, we investigate a \textsf{V}-type level scheme including three internal states of a dipole, $\ketz, \ketp$ and $\ketm$, as shown in~\tref{dipole-moments}. The relevant dipole matrix elements are
\begin{align} \tlabel{dipolemomentspm}
    d_0 = \smallbraketop{0}{d^0}{0}, \qquad
    d_\pm = \smallbraketop{\pm}{d^0}{\pm}, \qquad
    q_\pm &= |\smallbraketop{\pm}{d^\pm}{0}|.
\end{align}
As before, we define a vacuum state $\ket{G}=\prod_i \ketz_i$ as well as hardcore bosonic operators $\bop_\pm=\ketbra{0}{{\pm}}$ and $\nop_{\pm}=\bopd_{\pm}\bop_{\pm}$. We can either think of two different kinds of bosons (`$+$' excitations and `$-$' excitations) or think of a single boson with an internal spin degree of freedom. It is useful to write the spherical components of the dipole operator in terms of the bosonic operators:
\begin{align}
    d^0 &= d_+ \nop_+ + d_- \nop_- + d_0 (1-\nop_+-\nop_-) \\
        &= d_0 + (d_+-d_0) \nop_+ + (d_--d_0) \nop_-, \\
    d^+ &= q_+ \bopd_+ - q_- \bop_-, \\
    d^- &= - q_+ \bop_+  + q_- \bopd_-.
\end{align}
Restricting ourselves to a two-dimensional geometry with a perpendicular polarization, we can express the relevant parts of the dipole-dipole interaction from \tref{dop2d} as
\begin{align}
    d^0_i d^0_j &= d_0^2 + d_0(d_+-d_0) (\nop_{+,i}+\nop_{+,j}) + d_0(d_--d_0) (\nop_{-,i}+\nop_{-,j}) \\
                &\quad + (d_+ - d_0)^2 \nop_{+,i} \nop_{+,j} + (d_- - d_0)^2 \nop_{-,i} \nop_{-,j} \\
                &\quad + (d_+ - d_0)(d_- - d_0) (\nop_{+,i} \nop_{-,j} + \nop_{-,i} \nop_{+,j}) \\
    d^+_i d^-_j &= - q_+^2 \bopd_{+,i} \bop_{+,j} - q_-^2 \bopd_{-,j} \bop_{-,i} \\
    d^+_i d^+_j &= - q_+q_- (\bopd_{+,i} \bop_{-,j} + \bopd_{+,j} \bop_{-,i})
\end{align}
where we have neglected any excitation-non conserving terms. Further dropping the constant terms and \qu{magnetic field} terms, we find the many-body Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
    H = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i\ne j} \Hdd_{ij} = \sum_{i\ne j}  t_{ij}^{\alpha\beta} \bopd_{\alpha,i} \bop_{\beta,j}
    +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\ne j} V_{ij}^{\alpha\beta} \nop_{\alpha,i} \nop_{\beta,j}.
\end{align}
Here, a summation over the $\alpha, \beta$ indices, which label the internal state of the excitation, is assumed. This is a generalized (hard core) Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, including long-range hopping terms and long-range density-density interactions. In our case, the tunneling rates and interaction matrix elements are given by
\begin{align}
    t_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} \begin{pmatrix}
    -\frac{q_+^2}{2} & \frac{3q_+q_-}{2} \ef{-2i \phi_{ij}} \\
    \frac{3q_+q_-}{2} \ef{+2i \phi_{ij}} & -\frac{q_-^2}{2}
\end{pmatrix}, \\
    V_{ij}^{\alpha\beta} &= \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} (d_\alpha-d_0)(d_\beta-d_0).
\end{align}
By introducing the lattice spacing $a$, we can define the nearest-neighbor tunneling rates
\begin{align} \tlabel{nnrates}
    t^+ = \frac{\kappa q_{+}^2}{2a^3},\qquad
    t^- = \frac{\kappa q_{-}^2}{2a^3},\qquad
    w = \frac{3 \kappa q_{+}q_{-}}{2a^3}.
\end{align}
Using these, the single-particle tunneling part of the Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{align} \tlabel{pmmodel}
    H_\text{single} = \sum_{i\ne j} \frac{a^3}{R_{ij}^3}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \bop_{i,+} \\
        \bop_{i,-}
    \end{pmatrix}^{\!\dag}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -t^+ & w \ef{-2i \phi_{ij}} \\
        w \ef{2i \phi_{ij}} & -t^- \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \bop_{j,+} \\
        \bop_{j,-}
    \end{pmatrix}^{\vphantom\dag}.
\end{align}
This model is the basis for the realization of topological band structures in \cref{topological_bands}. The off-diagonal tunneling elements are a manifestation of the spin-orbit coupling which is present in these dipolar spin models.



\paragraph{One-dimensional system:}
In one dimension, we can always choose $\phi_{ij}=0$. Furthermore, if $q_+=q_-$, the tunneling
elements simplify to
\begin{align}
    t_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa q^2}{2R_{ij}^3} (3\sigma_x-\id).
\end{align}
By transforming to $\ket{x}=(\ketp-\ketm)/\sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{y}=(\ketp+\ketm)/\sqrt{2}$, the
tunneling part can be diagonalized:
\begin{align}
    t_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa q^2}{R_{ij}^3} \begin{pmatrix}
    -2 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
If the energy of the $\ket{x}, \ket{y}$ manifold is low enough compared to the $\ketz$ state, this
causes excitations to condense in the $\ket{x}$ state, building a ferroelectric state of matter. The accompanying quantum phase transition has been investigated in \refscite{Klinsmann2011,Klinsmann2014}.

\subsection{General case: four level dipoles in a tilted external field}
\tlabel{generalTilted}
Finally, we briefly discuss the most general case when all four states in \tref{dipole-moments} are involved. We assume the geometry from \tref{lattice-geometry} with a possibly tilted external field.
Introducing a bosonic operator $\bop_1=\ketbra{1}{0}$ for the additional state, we can write the tunneling rates in the basis $\{{+}, 1, {-}\}$:
\begin{align}
    t_{ij} &= \frac{\kappa}{R_{ij}^3} \begin{pmatrix}
    -\frac{q_+^2}{2} f_0 & \frac{3q_+ q_1}{\sqrt{2}} f_1^* & \frac{3q_+q_-}{2} f_2^* \\
    \frac{3q_+q_1}{\sqrt{2}} f_1 & q_1^2 f_0 & -\frac{3q_1q_-}{\sqrt{2}} f_1^* \\
    \frac{3q_+q_-}{2} f_2 & -\frac{3q_1q_-}{\sqrt{2}} f_1 & -\frac{q_-^2}{2} f_0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Here, $f_m = f_m(\Theta_0, \phi_{ij}-\Phi_0)$ are the functions defined in \tref{fmfunctions}.
Note that $f_1(\Theta_0, \phi_{ij}-\Phi_0)=0$ for an external field which is perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane ($\Theta=0$). This leads to an effective decoupling of the $\keto$ state from the other two, taking us back to the model in \tref{pmmodel}.
