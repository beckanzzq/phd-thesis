Despite being ideal models for complicated solid state systems, ultracold quantum gases lack one important aspect of the electronic complex: because of the charge neutrality of the atoms, there are no mobile charge carriers that possess a direct coupling to the magnetic vector potential. Plenty of interesting effects, however, arise when charged particles are subject to high magnetic fields in low dimensional systems. The most prominent ones are the integer quantum Hall effect \cite{Klitzing1980} as an example for the appearance of topological states, as well as the fractional quantum Hall effect \cite{Laughlin1983}, potentially giving rise to fundamental excitations with non-Abelian statistics.
