# phd-thesis
LaTeX sources for my PhD thesis

Requirements
------------
- it is probably a good idea to have `texlive-full` (or equivalent) installed
- Optionally: `latexmk`

Building
--------
Clone the repository including the submodule `latex-report`:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sharkdp/phd-thesis.git
```
Then, compile the document by calling `latexmk` from the root folder.
