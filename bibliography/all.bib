abstract = {Systems with long-range interactions show a variety of intriguing properties: they typically accommodate many meta-stable states, they can give rise to spontaneous formation of supersolids, and they can lead to counterintuitive thermodynamic behavior. However, the increased complexity that comes with long-range interactions strongly hinders theoretical studies. This makes a quantum simulator for long-range models highly desirable. Here, we show that a chain of trapped ions can be used to quantum simulate a one-dimensional model of hard-core bosons with dipolar off-site interaction and tunneling, equivalent to a dipolar XXZ spin-1/2 chain. We explore the rich phase diagram of this model in detail, employing perturbative mean-field theory, exact diagonalization, and quasiexact numerical techniques (density-matrix renormalization group and infinite time evolving block decimation). We find that the complete devil's staircase -- an infinite sequence of crystal states existing at vanishing tunneling -- spreads to a succession of lobes similar to the Mott-lobes found in Bose--Hubbard models. Investigating the melting of these crystal states at increased tunneling, we do not find (contrary to similar two-dimensional models) clear indications of supersolid behavior in the region around the melting transition. However, we find that inside the insulating lobes there are quasi-long range (algebraic) correlations, opposed to models with nearest-neighbor tunneling which show exponential decay of correlations.},

abstract = {We investigate strongly correlated phases of two-component (or pseudo-spin-1/2) Bose gases under rapid rotation through exact diagonalization on a torus geometry. In the case of pseudo-spin-independent contact interactions, we find the formation of gapped spin-singlet states at the filling factors $\backslash$nu=k/3+k/3 (k/3 filling for each component) with integer k. We present numerical evidences that the gapped state with k=2 is well described as a non-Abelian spin-singlet (NASS) state, in which excitations feature non-Abelian statistics. Furthermore, we find the phase transition from the product of composite fermion states to the NASS state by changing the ratio of the intercomponent to intracomponent interactions.},

At low temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size.

abstract = {We investigate bosonic Gaussian quantum states on an infinite cubic lattice in arbitrary spatial dimensions. We derive general properties of such states as ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians for both critical and non-critical cases. Tight analytic relations between the decay of the interaction and the correlation functions are proven and the dependence of the correlation length on band gap and effective mass is derived. We show that properties of critical ground states depend on the gap of the point-symmetrized rather than on that of the original Hamiltonian. For critical systems with polynomially decaying interactions logarithmic deviations from polynomially decaying correlation functions are found. Moreover, we provide a generalization of the matrix product state representation for Gaussian states and show that properties hold analogously to the case of finite dimensional spin systems.},

abstract = {We have realized long-lived ground-state polar molecules in a 3D optical lattice, with a lifetime of up to 25 s, which is limited only by off-resonant scattering of the trapping light. Starting from a 2D optical lattice, we observe that the lifetime increases dramatically as a small lattice potential is added along the tube-shaped lattice traps. The 3D optical lattice also dramatically increases the lifetime for weakly bound Feshbach molecules. For a pure gas of Feshbach molecules, we observe a lifetime of greater than 20 s in a 3D optical lattice; this represents a 100-fold improvement over previous results. This lifetime is also limited by off-resonant scattering, the rate of which is related to the size of the Feshbach molecule. Individually trapped Feshbach molecules in the 3D lattice can be converted to pairs of K and Rb atoms and back with nearly 100\% efficiency.},

This time-reversal-invariant setting represents a bosonic analogue of spin Hall systems. Using exact diagonalization, we find that (fractional) quantum spin Hall states composed of two nearly independent quantum Hall states are remarkably robust and persist even when \$g\_\{\backslash uparrow\backslash downarrow\}\backslash approx g\$. For \$g\_\{\backslash uparrow\backslash downarrow\}=-g\$, we obtain exact many-body ground states in which particles of different spin states form pairs. This gives the exact critical line beyond which the system collapses.},

@article{Beeler2013,
abstract = {Electronic properties such as current flow are generally independent of the electron's spin angular momentum, an internal degree of freedom possessed by quantum particles. The spin Hall effect, first proposed 40 years ago, is an unusual class of phenomena in which flowing particles experience orthogonally directed, spin-dependent forces--analogous to the conventional Lorentz force that gives the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two spin states. Spin Hall effects have been observed for electrons flowing in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as GaAs and InGaAs (refs 2, 3) and for laser light traversing dielectric junctions. Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a quantum-degenerate Bose gas, and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz forces to realize a cold-atom spin transistor. By engineering a spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field for our quantum gas, we explicitly introduce and measure the requisite spin-dependent Lorentz forces, finding them to be in excellent agreement with our calculations. This 'atomtronic' transistor behaves as a type of velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin selector, with potential application in devices such as magnetic or inertial sensors. In addition, such techniques for creating and measuring the spin Hall effect are clear prerequisites for engineering topological insulators and detecting their associated quantized spin Hall effects in quantum gases. As implemented, our system realizes a laser-actuated analogue to the archetypal semiconductor spintronic device, the Datta-Das spin transistor.},

Because of the frustrated nature of the second-neighbor interactions, topological Mott phases displaying the quantum Hall and the quantum spin Hall effects are found for spinless and spin fermion models, respectively. The mean-field phase diagram is presented and the fluctuations are treated within the random phase approximation. Renormalization group analysis shows that these states can be favored over the topologically trivial Mott insulating states.},

abstract = {We study the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using the density-matrix renormalization group. For the cases of on-site interactions and additional nearest-neighbor interactions the phase boundaries of the Mott insulators and charge-density wave phases are determined. We find a direct phase transition between the charge-density wave phase and the superfluid phase, and no supersolid or normal phases. In the presence of nearest-neighbor interaction the charge density wave phase is completely surrounded by a region in which the effective interactions in the superfluid phase are repulsive. In this region a single impurity causes the system to be insulating. An even bigger region of the superfluid phase is driven into a Bose-glass phase by any finite quenched disorder. We determine the boundaries of both regions in the phase diagram. The ac conductivity of the superfluid phase in the attractive and the repulsive region is calculated, and a big superfluid stiffness is found in the attractive as well as the repulsive region.},

abstract = {Owing to thermal fluctuations, two-dimensional (2D) systems cannot undergo a conventional phase transition associated with the breaking of a continuous symmetry1. Nevertheless they may exhibit a phase transition to a state with quasi-long-range order via the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) mechanism2. A paradigm example is the 2D Bose fluid, such as a liquid helium film3, which cannot condense at non-zero temperature although it becomes superfluid above a critical phase space density. The quasi-long-range coherence and the microscopic nature of the BKT transition were recently explored with ultracold atomic gases4, 5, 6. However, a direct observation of superfluidity in terms of frictionless flow is still missing for these systems. Here we probe the superfluidity of a 2D trapped Bose gas using a moving obstacle formed by a micrometre-sized laser beam. We find a dramatic variation of the response of the fluid, depending on its degree of degeneracy at the obstacle location.},

In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states in a cold, dense atomic gas. Our approach paves the way for quantum-by-quantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching, all-optical deterministic quantum logic and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light.},

abstract = {We consider one-dimensional topological insulators hosting fractionally charged midgap states in the presence and absence of induced superconductivity pairing. Under the protection of a discrete symmetry, relating positive and negative energy states, the solitonic midgap states remain pinned at zero energy when superconducting correlations are induced by proximity effect. When the superconducting pairing dominates the initial insulating gap, Majorana fermion phases develop for a class of insulators. As a concrete example, we study the Creutz model with induced \$s\$-wave superconductivity and repulsive Hubbard type interactions. For a finite wire, without interactions, the solitonic modes originating from the non-superconducting model survive at zero energy, revealing a fourfold degenerate ground state. However, interactions break the aforementioned discrete symmetry and completely remove this degeneracy, thereby producing a unique ground state which is characterized by a topological bulk invariant with respect to the product of fermion parity and bond inversion. In contrast, the Majorana edge modes are robust to interactions. Moreover, the parameter range for which a topological Majorana phase is stabilized expands when increasing the repulsive Hubbard interaction. The topological phase diagram of the interacting model is obtained using a combination of mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group techniques.},

abstract = {A quantum gas of ultracold polar molecules, with long-range and anisotropic interactions, not only would enable explorations of a large class of many-body physics phenomena but also could be used for quantum information processing. We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium (40K87Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 10(12) per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 x 10(-30) coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state.},

abstract = {We employ the exact diagonalization method to analyze the possibility of generating strongly correlated states in two-dimensional clouds of ultracold bosonic atoms which are subjected to a geometric gauge field created by coupling two internal atomic states to a laser beam. Tuning the gauge field strength, the system undergoes stepwise transitions between different ground states, which we describe by analytical trial wave functions, amongst them the Pfaffian, the Laughlin, and a Laughlin quasiparticle many-body state. The adiabatic following of the center of mass movement by the lowest energy dressed internal state, is lost by the mixing of the second internal state. This mixture can be controlled by the intensity of the laser field. The non-adiabaticity is inherent to the considered setup, and is shown to play the role of circular asymmetry. We study its influence on the properties of the ground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the numerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states with higher angular momentum. Thus, we propose generalized wave functions arising from the Laughlin and Pfaffian wave function by including components, where extra Jastrow factors appear, while preserving important features of these states. We analyze quasihole excitations over the Laughlin and generalized Laughlin states, and show that they possess effective fractional charge and obey anyonic statistics. Finally, we study the energy gap over the Laughlin state as the number of particles is increased keeping the chemical potential fixed. The gap is found to decrease as the number of particles is increased, indicating that the observability of the Laughlin state is restricted to a small number of particles.},

Meeting this challenge has garnered significant interest because permanent electric dipole moments are important for understanding symmetry breaking in molecular physics, control of chemical reactions and realization of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems.

By means of a superlattice structure we create a three-dimensional array of independent four-site plaquettes, which we can fully control and manipulate in parallel. Moreover, we show how small-scale plaquette resonating valence-bond (RVB) states with s- and d-wave symmetry can be created and characterized.

abstract = {The fundamental properties of light derive from its constituent particles--massless quanta (photons) that do not interact with one another. However, it has long been known that the realization of coherent interactions between individual photons, akin to those associated with conventional massive particles, could enable a wide variety of novel scientific and engineering applications. Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear medium inside which individual photons travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction, such that the propagation of photon pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound state. We achieve this through dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical evolution of the two-photon wavefunction using time-resolved quantum state tomography, and demonstrate a conditional phase shift exceeding one radian, resulting in polarization-entangled photon pairs. Particular applications of this technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic quantum logic and the generation of strongly correlated states of light.},

abstract = {In this paper we systematically classify and describe bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in all physical spatial dimensions using semiclassical nonlinear Sigma model (NLSM) field theories. All the SPT phases on a d-dimensional lattice discussed in this paper can be described by the same NLSM, which is an O(d+2) NLSM in (d+1)-dimensional space-time, with a topological Theta-term. The field in the NLSM is a semiclassical Landau order parameter with a unit length constraint. The classification of SPT phases discussed in this paper based on their NLSMs is Completely Identical to the more mathematical classification based on group cohomology given in reference 1 and 2. Besides the classification, the formalism used in this paper also allows us to discuss the physics at the boundary of the SPT phases, and it reveals the relation between SPT phases with different symmetries.},

@article{Pesin2009,
abstract = {Recent theory and experiment have revealed that strong spin-orbit coupling can have dramatic qualitative effects on the band structure of weakly interacting solids. Indeed, it leads to a distinct phase of matter, the topological band insulator. In this paper, we consider the combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and strong electron correlation, and show that the former has both quantitative and qualitative effects upon the correlation-driven Mott transition. As a specific example we take Ir-based pyrochlores, where the subsystem of Ir 5d electrons is known to undergo a Mott transition. At weak electron-electron interaction, we predict that Ir electrons are in a metallic phase at weak spin-orbit interaction, and in a topological band insulator phase at strong spin-orbit interaction. Very generally, we show that with increasing strength of the electron-electron interaction, the effective spin-orbit coupling is enhanced, increasing the domain of the topological band insulator. Furthermore, in our model, we argue that with increasing interactions, the topological band insulator is transformed into a "topological Mott insulator" phase, which is characterized by gapless surface spin-only excitations. The full phase diagram also includes a narrow region of gapless Mott insulator with a spinon Fermi surface, and a magnetically ordered state at still larger electron-electron interaction.},

abstract = {Spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) provide a powerful tool to investigate interesting gauge-field related phenomena. We study the ground state properties of such a system and show that it can be mapped to the well-known Dicke model in quantum optics, which describes the interactions between an ensemble of atoms and an optical field. A central prediction of the Dicke model is a quantum phase transition between a superradiant phase and a normal phase. Here we detect this transition in a spin-orbit coupled BEC by measuring various physical quantities across the phase transition. These quantities include the spin polarization, the relative occupation of the nearly degenerate single particle states, the quantity analogous to the photon field occupation, and the period of a collective oscillation (quadrupole mode). The applicability of the Dicke model to spin-orbit coupled BECs may lead to interesting applications in quantum optics and quantum information science.},

abstract = {In Rydberg atoms, at least one electron is excited to a state with a high principal quantum number. In an ultracold environment, this low-energy electron can scatter off a ground state atom allowing for the formation of a Rydberg molecule consisting of one Rydberg atom and several ground state atoms. Here we investigate those Rydberg molecules created by photoassociation for the spherically symmetric S-states. A step by step increase of the principal quantum number up to n=111 enables us to go beyond the previously observed dimer and trimer states up to a molecule, where four ground state atoms are bound by one Rydberg atom. The increase of bound atoms and the decreasing binding potential per atom with principal quantum number results finally in an overlap of spectral lines. The associated density-dependent line broadening sets a fundamental limit, for example, for the optical thickness per blockade volume in Rydberg quantum optics experiments.},

abstract = {The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity. However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N ≈ 30 particles. Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator--a special-purpose 'analogue' processor built using quantum bits (qubits)--would be inherently suited to solving such problems. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two- or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, in part because of the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction, J(i,j), on a naturally occurring, two-dimensional triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-half particles (beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap). This is a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than previous experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J(i,j) proportional variant d(-a)(i,j), where 0 ≤ a ≤ 3 and d(i,j) is the distance between spin pairs. These power laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a = 0), Coulomb-like (a = 1), monopole-dipole (a = 2) and dipole-dipole (a = 3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with a theory for 0.05 ≲ a ≲ 1.4. This demonstration, coupled with the high spin count, excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap, brings within reach the simulation of otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism.},

The third is to explore many-body physics inaccessible to existing theoretical techniques.

abstract = {Spin-orbit (SO) coupling--the interaction between a quantum particle's spin and its momentum--is ubiquitous in physical systems. In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect and topological insulators; it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices. Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers. Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition. The engineered SO coupling--equally applicable for bosons and fermions--sets the stage for the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.},

@article{Hazzard2014,
abstract = {By applying complementary analytic and numerical methods, we investigate the dynamics of spin-\$1/2\$ XXZ models with variable-range interactions in arbitrary dimensions. The dynamics we consider is initiated from uncorrelated states that are easily prepared in experiments, and can be equivalently viewed as either Ramsey spectroscopy or a quantum quench. Our primary focus is the dynamical emergence of correlations and entanglement in these far-from-equilibrium interacting quantum systems: we characterize these correlations by the entanglement entropy, concurrence, and squeezing, which are inequivalent measures of entanglement corresponding to different quantum resources. In one spatial dimension, we show that the time evolution of correlation functions manifests a non-perturbative dynamic singularity. This singularity is characterized by a universal power-law exponent that is insensitive to small perturbations. Explicit realizations of these models in current experiments using polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, magnetic atoms, and alkaline-earth and alkali atoms in optical lattices, along with the relative merits and limitations of these different systems, are discussed.},

abstract = {We investigate Fermi liquid states of the ultra-cold magnetic dipolar Fermi gases in the simplest two-component case including both thermodynamic instabilities and collective excitations. The magnetic dipolar interaction is invariant under the simultaneous spin-orbit rotation, but not under either the spin or the orbit one. Therefore, the corresponding Fermi liquid theory is intrinsically spin-orbit coupled. This is a fundamental feature of magnetic dipolar Fermi gases different from electric dipolar ones. The Landau interaction matrix is calculated and is diagonalized in terms of the spin-orbit coupled partial-wave channels of the total angular momentum J. The leading thermodynamic instabilities lie in the channels of ferromagnetism hybridized with the ferronematic order with J = 1+ and the spin-current mode with J = 1-, where + and - represent even and odd parities, respectively. An exotic propagating collective mode is identified as spin-orbit coupled Fermi surface oscillations in which spin distribution on the Fermi surface exhibits a topologically nontrivial hedgehog configuration.},

abstract = {In this paper, the variation of the intrinsic domain magnetization of a ferromagnetic with the external magnetic field, is obtained. The basis of the treatment is the exchange interaction model amplified by explicit consideration of the dipole-dipole interaction between the atomic magnets. Approximations appropriate to low temperatures and equivalent to those used by Bloch in his derivation of the T1 law, are introduced. The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the order of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10-4. The results are compared with experiment and satisfactory agreement is found.},

Density-dependent measurements of the resonant population exchange for atoms initially excited into the 32P3/2(|mJ|=3/2) state are compared with a Monte Carlo model for coherent energy transfer. The model is based on simulations of small atom subensembles involving up to ten atoms interacting via coherent pair processes. The role of interatomic mechanical forces due to the resonant dipole-dipole interaction is investigated. Good agreement is found between the experimental data and the predictions of the model, from which we infer that atomic motion has negligible influence on the energy transfer up to Rydberg densities of 108 cm-3, that the system has to be described in terms of many-body dynamics, and that the energy transfer preserves coherence on microsecond timescales.},

abstract = {The robustness of fractional quantum Hall states is measured as the energy gap separating the Laughlin ground-state from excitations. Using thermodynamic approximations for the correlation functions of the Laughlin state and the quasihole state, we evaluate the gap in a two-dimensional system of dipolar atoms exposed to an artificial gauge field. For Abelian fields, our results agree well with the results of exact diagonalization for small systems, but indicate that the large value of the gap predicted in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 070404 (2005)] was overestimated. However, we are able to show that the small gap found in the Abelian scenario is dramatically increased if we turn to non-Abelian fields squeezing the Landau levels.},

abstract = {The Schrodinger equation i Psi =(A+Bt) Psi with constant Hermitian matrices A and B is studied. In the form where B is diagonalized, this equation is a generalization of the Landau-Zener problem to an arbitrary number of crossing energy levels. An approach-the independent crossing approximation-leading to a partial understanding of the general case in terms of the two-level problem is introduced. It is found that certain S-matrix elements (and thus the corresponding transition probabilities) for the general problem are exactly given by formulae of unexpected simplicity, suggesting that some kind of general analytic solution might exist. The full S-matrix is calculated for a solvable special case of the problem. The solution of another special case, previously discovered for systems with three states, is generalized to any number of states. The asymptotic behaviour of the system is discussed in general and given explicitly to lowest order in 1/t.},

abstract = {All-optical switching is a technique in which a gate light pulse changes the transmission of a target light pulse without the detour via electronic signal processing. We take this to the quantum regime, where the incoming gate light pulse contains only one photon on average. The gate pulse is stored as a Rydberg excitation in an ultracold atomic gas using electromagnetically induced transparency. Rydberg blockade suppresses the transmission of the subsequent target pulse. Finally, the stored gate photon can be retrieved. A retrieved photon heralds successful storage. The corresponding postselected subensemble shows an extinction of 0.05. The single-photon switch offers many interesting perspectives ranging from quantum communication to quantum information processing.},

The relation between two different interpretations of the Hall conductance as topological invariants is clarified. One is the Thouless–Kohmoto–Nightingale–den Nijs (TKNN) integer in the infinite system and the other is a winding number of the edge state. In the TKNN form of the Hall conductance, a phase of the Bloch wave function defines U(1) vortices on the magnetic Brillouin zone and the total vorticity gives $\sigma$xy. We find that these vortices are given by the edge states when they are degenerate with the bulk states.},

abstract = {The non-perturbative effect of interaction can sometimes make interacting bosons behave as though they were free fermions. The system of neutral bosons in a rapidly rotating atomic trap is equivalent to charged bosons coupled to a magnetic field, which has opened up the possibility of fractional quantum Hall effect for bosons interacting with a short range interaction. Motivated by the composite fermion theory of the fractional Hall effect of electrons, we test the idea that the interacting bosons map into non-interacting spinless fermions carrying one vortex each, by comparing wave functions incorporating this physics with exact wave functions available for systems containing up to 12 bosons. We study here the analogy between interacting bosons at filling factors \$\backslash nu=n/(n+1)\$ with non-interacting fermions at \$\backslash nu\^{}*=n\$ for the ground state as well as the low-energy excited states and find that it provides a good account of the behavior for small \$n\$, but interactions between fermions become increasingly important with \$n\$. At \$\backslash nu=1\$, which is obtained in the limit \$n\backslash rightarrow \backslash infty\$, the fermionization appears to overcompensate for the repulsive interaction between bosons, producing an \{$\backslash$em attractive\} interactions between fermions, as evidenced by a pairing of fermions here.},

abstract = {We study topological phases of interacting systems in two spatial dimensions in the absence of topological order (i.e., with a unique ground state on closed manifolds and no fractional excitations). These are the closest interacting analogs of integer quantum Hall states, topological insulators, and superconductors. We adapt the well-known Chern-Simons K-matrix description of quantum Hall states to classify such “integer” topological phases. Our main result is a general formalism that incorporates symmetries into the K-matrix description. Remarkably, this simple analysis yields the same list of topological phases as a recent group cohomology classification, and in addition provides field theories and explicit edge theories for all these phases. The bosonic topological phases, which only appear in the presence of interactions and which remain well defined in the presence of disorder, include (i) bosonic insulators with a Hall conductance quantized to even integers, (ii) a bosonic analog of quantum spin Hall insulators, and (iii) a bosonic analog of a chiral topological superconductor, whose K matrix is the Cartan matrix of Lie group E8. We also discuss interacting fermion systems where symmetries are realized in a projective fashion, where we find the present formalism can handle a wider range of symmetries than a recent group super-cohomology classification. Lastly, we construct microscopic models of these phases from coupled one-dimensional systems.},

It is key to understanding a variety of magnetic, spin-transport, and topological phenomena, such as Majorana fermions and recently discovered topological insulators. Implementing and controlling spin-orbit coupling is thus highly desirable and could open untapped opportunities for the exploration of unique quantum physics. In this paper we show that dipole-dipole interactions can produce an effective SOC in two-dimensional ultracold polar molecule gases. This SOC generates chiral excitations with a non-trivial Berry phase \$2\backslash pi\$. These excitations, which we call $\backslash$emph\{chirons\}, resemble low-energy quasiparticles in bilayer graphene and manifest themselves in the dynamics of the spin density profile, spin currents, and spin coherences, even for molecules pinned in a deep optical lattice.

This Hamiltonian describes the motion of charged particles in strong magnetic fields. Laser-assisted tunneling processes are characterized by studying the expansion of the atoms in the lattice. The band structure of this Hamiltonian should display Hofstadter's butterfly. For fermions, this scheme should realize the quantum Hall effect and chiral edge states.},

@article{Chen2013,
abstract = {Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are gapped short-range-entangled quantum phases with a symmetry G, which can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. In this paper, we propose that distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain anti-unitary time reversal symmetry) are classified/labeled by elements in H\^{}\{1+d\}[G,U\_T(1)] -- the (1+d)-Borel-cohomology group of G over the G-module U\_T(1). Our construction is based on a new type of topological term that generalizes the topological theta-term in continuous non-linear sigma-model to discrete non-linear sigma-models. The boundary excitations of the non-trivial SPT phases are described by continuous/discrete non-linear sigma-models with a non-local Lagrangian term that generalizes the Wess-Zumino-Witten term for continuous non-linear sigma-models. We argue that those boundary excitations are gapless, if the symmetry is not broken on the boundary. As an application of our classification, we find that interacting bosonic topological insulators (with time reversal and U(1) symmetry) are classified by H\^{}\{1+d\}[U(1) x| Z\_2\^{}T,U\_T(1)], which contain one non-trivial phases in 1D or 2D, and three in 3D. We also classified interacting bosonic topological superconductors (with time reversal symmetry only), in term of H\^{}\{1+d\}[Z\_2\^{}T,U\_T(1)], which contain one non-trivial phase in odd spatial dimensions and non for even. Our classification is much more general than the above two examples, since it is for any symmetry group. For example, the SPT phases of integer spin systems with time reversal and U(1) symmetry are classified by H\^{}\{1+d\}[U(1) x Z\_2\^{}T,U\_T(1)], which contain three non-trivial SPT phases in 1D, non in 2D, and seven in 3D.},

Another unique feature is that upon crossing over to two dimensions with coupled ladders, the edge modes from each ladder form a parity-protected flat band at zero energy, opening the route to strongly correlated states controlled by interactions. Experimental signatures are found in density correlations and phase transitions to trivial band and Mott insulators.},

abstract = {Motivated by new capabilities to realize artificial gauge fields in ultracold atomic systems, and by their potential to access correlated topological phases in lattice systems, we present a new strategy for designing topologically nontrivial band structures. Our approach is simple and direct: it amounts to considering tight-binding models directly in reciprocal space. These models naturally cause atoms to experience highly uniform magnetic flux density and lead to topological bands with very narrow dispersion, without fine-tuning of parameters. Further, our construction immediately yields instances of optical Chern lattices, as well as band structures with Chern numbers of magnitude larger than one.},

abstract = {We report on the formation of ultracold weakly bound Feshbach molecules of Na23K40, the first fermionic molecule that is chemically stable in its absolute ground state. The lifetime of the nearly degenerate molecular gas exceeds 100 ms in the vicinity of the Feshbach resonance. The measured dependence of the molecular binding energy on the magnetic field demonstrates the open-channel character of the molecules over a wide field range and implies significant singlet admixture. This will enable efficient transfer into the singlet vibrational ground state, resulting in a stable molecular Fermi gas with strong dipolar interactions.},

abstract = {We show that single-component fermionic polar molecules confined to a 2D geometry and dressed by a microwave field may acquire an attractive 1/r(3) dipole-dipole interaction leading to superfluid p-wave pairing at sufficiently low temperatures even in the BCS regime. The emerging state is the topological p(x) + ip(y) phase promising for topologically protected quantum information processing. The main decay channel is via collisional transitions to dressed states with lower energies and is rather slow, setting a lifetime of the order of seconds at 2D densities approximately 10(8) cm(-2).},

abstract = {We discuss in detail the implementation of an open-system quantum simulator with Rydberg states of neutral atoms held in an optical lattice. Our scheme allows one to realize both coherent as well as dissipative dynamics of complex spin models involving many-body interactions and constraints. The central building block of the simulation scheme is constituted by a mesoscopic Rydberg gate that permits the entanglement of several atoms in an efficient, robust and quick protocol. In addition, optical pumping on ancillary atoms provides the dissipative ingredient for engineering the coupling between the system and a tailored environment. As an illustration, we discuss how the simulator enables the simulation of coherent evolution of quantum spin models such as the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and Kitaev's toric code, which involves four-body spin interactions. We moreover show that in principle also the simulation of lattice fermions can be achieved. As an example for controlled dissipative dynamics, we discuss ground state cooling of frustration-free spin Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {The quantum mechanical states of electrons in atoms and molecules are discrete spatial orbitals, which are fundamental for our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids. They determine a wide range of basic atomic properties, ranging from the coupling to external fields to the whole field of chemistry. Nevertheless, the manifestation of electron orbitals in experiments so far has been rather indirect. In a detailed theoretical model, we analyze the impact of a single Rydberg electron onto a Bose-Einstein condensate and compare the results to experimental data. Based on this validated model we propose a method to optically image the shape of single electron orbitals using electron-phonon coupling in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This scheme requires only established and readily available experimental techniques and allows to directly capture textbook-like spatial images of single electronic orbitals in a single shot experiment.},

abstract = {How does a chemical reaction proceed at ultralow temperatures? Can simple quantum mechanical rules such as quantum statistics, single partial-wave scattering, and quantum threshold laws provide a clear understanding of the molecular reactivity under a vanishing collision energy? Starting with an optically trapped near-quantum-degenerate gas of polar 40K87Rb molecules prepared in their absolute ground state, we report experimental evidence for exothermic atom-exchange chemical reactions. When these fermionic molecules were prepared in a single quantum state at a temperature of a few hundred nanokelvin, we observed p-wave-dominated quantum threshold collisions arising from tunneling through an angular momentum barrier followed by a short-range chemical reaction with a probability near unity. When these molecules were prepared in two different internal states or when molecules and atoms were brought together, the reaction rates were enhanced by a factor of 10 to 100 as a result of s-wave scattering, which does not have a centrifugal barrier. The measured rates agree with predicted universal loss rates related to the two-body van der Waals length.},

abstract = {In this work we consider a system of spinless fermions with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor repulsive Hubbard interactions on a honeycomb lattice, and propose and analyze a realistic scheme for analog quantum simulation of this model with cold atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal optical lattice. To this end, we first derive the zero-temperature phase diagram of the interacting model within a mean-field theory treatment. We show that besides a semimetallic and a charge-density-wave ordered phase, the system exhibits a quantum anomalous Hall phase, which is generated dynamically, i.e., purely as a result of the repulsive fermionic interactions and in the absence of any external gauge fields. We establish the topological nature of this dynamically created Mott-insulating phase by the numerical calculation of a Chern number, and we study the possibility of coexistence of this phase with any of the other phases characterized by local order parameters. Based on the knowledge of the mean-field phase diagram, we then discuss in detail how the interacting Hamiltonian can be engineered effectively by state-of-the-art experimental techniques for laser dressing of cold fermionic ground-state atoms with electronically excited Rydberg states that exhibit strong dipolar interactions.},

abstract = {Detecting topological order in cold-atom experiments is an outstanding challenge, the resolution of which offers novel perspectives on topological matter. In material systems, unambiguous signatures of topological order exist for topological insulators and quantum Hall devices. In quantum Hall systems, the quantized conductivity and the associated robust propagating edge modes - guaranteed by the existence of non-trivial topological invariants - have been observed through transport and spectroscopy measurements. Here, we show that optical-lattice-based experiments can be tailored to directly visualize the propagation of topological edge modes. Our method is rooted in the unique capability for initially shaping the atomic gas, and imaging its time-evolution after suddenly removing the shaping potentials. Our scheme, applicable to an assortment of atomic topological phases, provides the first method for imaging the dynamics of topological edge modes, directly revealing their angular velocity and spin structure.},

We show that bound vortex pairs polarize and screen the vortex-antivortex interaction leaving only the logarithmic attraction at sufficiently large separations between the vortices.

abstract = {Topological features[mdash]global properties not discernible locally[mdash]emerge in systems ranging from liquid crystals to magnets to fractional quantum Hall systems. A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter[mdash]topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both non-interacting and many-body regimes.},

abstract = {We use a quantum Monte Carlo method to investigate various classes of 2D spin models with long-range interactions at low temperatures. In particular, we study a dipolar XXZ model with U(1) symmetry that appears as a hard-core boson limit of an extended Hubbard model describing polarized dipolar atoms or molecules in an optical lattice. Tunneling, in such a model, is short-range, whereas density-density couplings decay with distance following a cubic power law. We investigate also an XXZ model with long-range couplings of all three spin components - such a model describes a system of ultracold ions in a lattice of microtraps. We describe an approximate phase diagram for such systems at zero and at ?nite temperature, and compare their properties. In particular, we compare the extent of crystalline, super?uid, and supersolid phases. Our predictions apply directly to current experiments with mesoscopic numbers of polar molecules and trapped ions.},

At constant electron number density the hexagonal lattice has the lowest energy. Phonon dispersion curves have been calculated for wave vectors along the symmetry directions in the first Brillouin zone for the hexagonal lattice. In the long-wavelength limit one of the two branches of the dispersion relation vanishes with vanishing two-dimensional wave vector q⃗ as q, the second as q1/2. The coefficient of q in the former branch is pure imaginary for certain directions of propagation in the square lattice, implying a dynamical instability of this lattice; the hexagonal lattice is stable. The vibrational zero-point energy and low-temperature thermodynamic functions have been obtained for the hexagonal lattice. The dielectric susceptibility tensor of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal $\chi$$\alpha$$\beta$(q⃗) has been determined in the long-wavelength limit, in the presence of a static magnetic field perpendicular to the crystal, and the result has been used to obtain the dispersion relation for plasma oscillations in the electron crystal.},

abstract = {Symmetry protected topological (SPT) states are short-range entangled states with symmetry. Nontrivial SPT states have symmetry protected gapless edge excitations. In 2-dimension (2D), there are infinite number of nontrivial SPT phases with SU(2) or SO(3) symmetry. These phases can be described by SU(2)/SO(3) nonlinear-sigma models with a quantized topological $\backslash$theta-term. At open boundary, the $\backslash$theta-term becomes the Wess-Zumino-Witten term and consequently the boundary excitations are decoupled gapless left movers and right movers. Only the left movers (if $\backslash$theta>0) carry the SU(2)/SO(3) quantum numbers. As a result, the SU(2) SPT phases have a half-integer quantized spin Hall conductance and the SO(3) SPT phases an even-integer quantized spin Hall conductance. Both the SU(2)/SO(3) SPT phases are symmetric under their U(1) subgroup and can be viewed as U(1) SPT phases with even-integer quantized Hall conductance.},

abstract = {Understanding the many-body dynamics of isolated quantum systems is one of the central challenges in modern physics. To this end, the direct experimental realization of strongly correlated quantum systems allows one to gain insights into the emergence of complex phenomena. Such insights enable the development of theoretical tools that broaden our understanding. Here, we theoretically model and experimentally probe with Ramsey spectroscopy the quantum dynamics of disordered, dipolar-interacting, ultracold molecules in a partially filled optical lattice. We report the capability to control the dipolar interaction strength, and we demonstrate that the many-body dynamics extends well beyond a nearest-neighbor or mean-field picture, and cannot be quantitatively described using previously available theoretical tools. We develop a novel cluster expansion technique and demonstrate that our theoretical method accurately captures the measured dependence of the spin dynamics on molecule number and on the dipolar interaction strength. In the spirit of quantum simulation, this agreement simultaneously benchmarks the new theoretical method and verifies our microscopic understanding of the experiment. Our findings pave the way for numerous applications in quantum information science, metrology, and condensed matter physics.},

@article{Hadzibabic2006,
abstract = {Any state of matter is classified according to its order, and the type of order that a physical system can possess is profoundly affected by its dimensionality. Conventional long-range order, as in a ferromagnet or a crystal, is common in three-dimensional systems at low temperature. However, in two-dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry, true long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature. Consequently, for the case of identical bosons, a uniform two-dimensional fluid cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, in contrast to the three-dimensional case. However, the two-dimensional system can form a 'quasi-condensate' and become superfluid below a finite critical temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory associates this phase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the pairing of vortices with opposite circulation. Above the critical temperature, proliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation of a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms. Using a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength fluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence coincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT theory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in mesoscopic systems.},

abstract = {The control of quantum systems is of fundamental scientific interest and promises powerful applications and technologies. Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation.},

As a consequence, the chemical potential drops below the cyclotron energy 2 variant Planck's over 2pi Omega. While in this mean-field quantum-Hall regime we still observe an ordered vortex lattice, its elastic shear strength is strongly reduced, as evidenced by the observed very low frequency of Tkachenko modes. Furthermore, the gas approaches the quasi-two-dimensional limit. The associated crossover from interacting- to ideal-gas behavior along the rotation axis results in a shift of the axial breathing mode frequency.},

We show that the combination of bi-chromatic optical lattices with Raman transitions can allow the engineering of a spin-dependent tunneling of the atoms between neighboring lattice sites. These assisted-hopping processes can be employed for the quantum simulation of various interesting models, ranging from non-interacting relativistic fermionic theories to topological insulators.

abstract = {The formation of molecules and supramolecular structures results from bonding by conservative forces acting among electrons and nuclei and giving rise to equilibrium configurations defined by minima of the interaction potential. Here we show that bonding can also occur by the non-conservative forces responsible for interaction-induced coherent population trapping. The bound state arises in a dissipative process and manifests itself as a stationary state at a preordained interatomic distance. Remarkably, such a dissipative bonding is present even when the interactions among the atoms are purely repulsive. The dissipative bound states can be created and studied spectroscopically in present-day experiments with ultracold atoms or molecules and can potentially serve for cooling strongly interacting quantum gases.},

@article{Konig2007,
abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d < 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d > 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field–induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect. },

@article{Babadi2012,
abstract = {We study the collective excitations of polarized single-component quasi-two-dimensional dipolar fermions in an isotropic harmonic trap by solving the collisional Boltzmann-Vlasov (CBV) equation. We study the response to both monopole and quadrupole perturbations of the trap potential and investigate the character of excitations in each case. Simple analytic formulas are provided based on the linearized scaling ansatz and accurate numerical results are obtained by satisfying the first eight moments of the CBV equation. Except for the lowest lying monopole mode that exhibits a negligible damping in all of the studied cases, the quadrupole and the higher order monopole modes undergo a transition from the collisionless regime to a highly dissipative crossover regime and finally to the hydrodynamic regime upon increasing the dipolar interaction strength. For strong vertical confinements (2D limit), we predict the existence of a temperature window within which the characteristics of the collective modes become temperature independent. This behavior, which is a unique feature of the universal near-threshold dipole-dipole scatterings, persists as long as the scattering energies remain in the near-threshold regime. The predictions of this work are expected to be in the reach of current experiments.},

@article{Kim2010,
abstract = {A network is frustrated when competing interactions between nodes prevent each bond from being satisfied. This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses. Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions, whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces. We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.},

Starting from a general discussion on interaction design techniques and microscopic Hamiltonians, we provide a summary of recent work focused on many-body properties of dipolar systems, including: weakly interacting Bose gases, weakly interacting Fermi gases, multilayer systems, strongly interacting dipolar gases and dipolar gases in 1D and quasi-1D geometries. Within each of these topics, purely dipolar effects and connections with experimental realizations are emphasized.},

abstract = {A topological insulator is characterized by a dichotomy between the interior and the edge of a finite system: While the bulk has a non-zero energy gap, the edges are forced to sustain excitations traversing these gaps. Originally proposed for electrons governed by quantum mechanics, it has remained an important open question if the same physics can be observed for systems obeying Newton's equations of motion. Here, we report on measurements that characterize the collective behavior of mechanical oscillators exhibiting the phenomenology of the quantum spin hall effect. The phononic edge modes are shown to be helical and we demonstrate their topological protection via the stability against imperfections. Our results open the door to the design of topological acoustic meta-materials that can capitalize on the stability of the surfaces phonons as reliable wave guides.},

Our numerical results on the TCTP model indicates that Haldane-Rezayi state describes the critical point between strong and weak d-wave pairing quantum Hall phases. Further increasing the attractive zeroth pseudopotentials, the system transits from the strong-pairing phase to a stripe phase, and then to a cluster phase (or phase separation). The dipolar interaction can be mapped onto the TCTP model in the strong-pairing phase, if high order pseudopotentials are ignored. Our numerical results show that this is indeed the case, so the strong-pairing phase can be realized in the cold atom system.},

The characteristics of the Rydberg interaction gives rise to interesting many-body ground states different from standard FQH physics in the lowest Landau level (LLL). Due to the rapid fall-off of the interaction potential with distance Laughlin ground states are energetically favorable compared to noncorrelated Wigner crystals for filling fractions as low as \$\backslash nu=1/12\$. Exact diagonalization studies suggest however the existence of an extended range of filling fractions with a correlated Wigner crystal ground state below \$\backslash nu\backslash approx 1/6\$. When the average particle distance becomes less than the blockade radius which describes the region of saturated, almost constant interaction potential, strongly correlated cluster liquids are found for fillings \$\backslash nu\backslash gtrsim 1/4\$ and a bubble crystal phase is predicted for smaller fillings.},

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example of studies of the Bose-Einstein condensation in a system with realistic long-range interactions. We find that for the magnetic moment of e.g. chromium and a typical value of the scattering length all solutions are stable and only differ in size from condensates without long-range interactions. By lowering the value of the scattering length we find a region of unstable solutions. In the neighborhood of this region the ground state wavefunctions show internal structures not seen before in condensates.

After a brief introduction to second quantisation notation, which is used extensively, I focus of the "four H's": the Huckel (or tight binding), Hubbard, Heisenberg and Holstein models. Some other related models, such as the Pariser-Parr-Pople model, the extended Hubbard model, multi-orbital models and the ionic Hubbard model, are also discussed. Finally, I discuss the epistemological basis of effective Hamiltonians and compare and contrast this with that of ab initio methods as well as discussing the problem of parametrising effective Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems exhibits a variety of exotic phases with long-range quantum correlations, such as spin liquids and supersolids. Despite the rapid increase in computational power of modern computers, the numerical simulation of these complex systems becomes intractable even for a few dozens of particles. Feynman's idea of quantum simulators offers an innovative way to bypass this computational barrier. However, the proposed realizations of such devices either require very low temperatures (ultracold gases in optical lattices, trapped ions, superconducting devices) and considerable technological effort, or are extremely hard to scale in practice (NMR, linear optics). In this work, we propose a new architecture for a scalable quantum simulator that can operate at room temperature. It consists of strongly-interacting nuclear spins attached to the diamond surface by its direct chemical treatment, or by means of a functionalized graphene sheet. The initialization, control and read-out of this quantum simulator can be accomplished with nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted in diamond. The system can be engineered to simulate a wide variety of interesting strongly-correlated models with long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Due to the superior coherence time of nuclear spins and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, our proposal offers new opportunities towards large-scale quantum simulation at room temperatures.},

@article{Yan2013,
abstract = {With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

The interplay between the interlayer tunneling, SOC and intralayer atomic interaction gives rise to a diverse phase diagram. We demonstrate that the system can undergo a transition to a new type of stripe phase, which spontaneously breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Different from the ordinary Rashba-type SOC, a half-skyrmion lattice can emerge spontaneously in the bilayer system without strong harmonic traps. Furthermore, we predict the occurrence of a tetracritical point in the phase diagram of the bilayer BEC, where four different quantum phases merge together.

The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena.

While many unconventional superconductors with Cooper pairs of finite \$\backslash ell\$ have been discovered, their counterparts, density waves with non-zero angular momenta, have only been hypothesized in two-dimensional electron systems (Nayak, 2000). Using an unbiased functional renormalization group analysis, we here show that spin-triplet particle-hole condensates with \$\backslash ell=1\$ emerge generically in dipolar Fermi gases of atoms (Lu, Burdick, and Lev, 2012) or molecules (Ospelkaus et al., 2008; Wu et al.) on optical lattice. The order parameter of these exotic SDWs is a vector quantity in spin space, and, moreover, is defined on lattice bonds rather than on lattice sites. We determine the rich quantum phase diagram of dipolar fermions at half-filling as a function of the dipolar orientation, and discuss how these SDWs arise amidst competition with superfluid and charge density wave phases.},

abstract = {This book emphasizes the role that electron interactions play in the properties of condensed matter. It teaches the use of the powerful nonperturbative techniques that have become available in the last decades to discuss such topics as mixed valence systems, Kondo systems, heavy electrons, high-temperature copper oxide superconductors, the quantum Hall effect, and low-dimensional isotropic magnets. Mathematical derivations are self contained. Appendices provide standard many-body tools including second quantization, Grassmann variables, generating functionals, linear response, correlation functions, Fermi and Bose coherent-states path integrals, Matsubara representation, and the method of steepest descents. There are guided bibliographies and exercises at the end of each chapter.},

abstract = {Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.},

abstract = {The interplay between interaction and inhomogeneity for electrons in solids generates many interesting phenomena, including insulating and metallic behaviour, magnetism, superconductivity, quantum criticality and more exotic phases1. Many of the same phenomena appear in ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices2, which provide clean, controlled and tunable ‘quantum simulators’ to explore the intriguing physics of fermionic systems. Although density functional theory3, 4, 5 (DFT) is widely used to calculate material properties6, it has not yet been applied to cold atomic gases in optical lattices. Here we present a new density functional for short-range interactions (as opposed to Coulomb interactions of electrons), which renders DFT suitable for atomic Fermi gases. This grants us access to an extensive toolset, previously developed for materials simulations, to calculate the static and dynamic properties of atomic Fermi gases in optical lattices and external potentials. Ultracold atom quantum simulators can in turn be used to explore limitations of DFT functionals, and to further improve hybrid functionals, thus forming a bridge between materials simulations and atomic physics.},

For low densities, we find exact degenerate ground states, each of which is a Wigner solid with nonoverlapping Wannier states on the flat band. At higher densities, the many-body system, when projected onto the lower flat band, can be mapped to a spin-chain model. This mapping enables us to reveal the existence of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid comprising pairs of bosons. Interestingly, the high- and low-density regions have an overlap, where the two phases coexist.},

abstract = {Neutral atomic Bose condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have been used to realize important many-body phenomena in their most simple and essential forms, without many of the complexities usually associated with material systems. However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.},

abstract = {We study the appearance of correlated many-body phenomena in an ensemble of atoms driven resonantly into a strongly interacting Rydberg state. The ground state of the Hamiltonian describing the driven system exhibits a second order quantum phase transition. We derive the critical theory for the quantum phase transition and show that it describes the properties of the driven Rydberg system in the saturated regime. We find that the suppression of Rydberg excitations known as blockade phenomena exhibits an algebraic scaling law with a universal exponent.},

@article{Fukuhara2013,
abstract = {The existence of bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in one-dimensional quantum magnets was predicted almost 80 years ago. Identifying signatures of magnon bound states has so far remained the subject of intense theoretical research, and their detection has proved challenging for experiments. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting in which to find such bound states by tracking the spin dynamics with single-spin and single-site resolution following a local excitation. Here we use in situ correlation measurements to observe two-magnon bound states directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain comprising ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum dynamics of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single-magnon excitations. We also determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is probably limited by scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results provide a new way of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally, properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems.},

We study hard-core bosons with short-range interactions in two representative TFB models, one of which is the well known Haldane model (but with different parameters). We demonstrate that FQHE states emerge with signatures of even number of quasi-degenerate ground states on a torus and a robust spectrum gap separating these states from higher energy spectrum.

We find good agreement between our experimental results and those of a numerical simulation of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, including contact and dipolar interactions as well as three-body losses.

The simplest example of a FTI consists of two decoupled copies of a Laughlin state with opposite chiralities. We focus on bosons at half filling. We study the stability of the FTI phase upon addition of two coupling terms of different nature: an interspin interaction term, and an inversion symmetry breaking term that couples the copies at the single particle level. Using exact diagonalization and entanglement spectra, we numerically show that the FTI phase is stable against both perturbations. We compare our system to a similar bilayer fractional Chern insulator. We show evidence that the time reversal invariant system survives the introduction of interaction coupling on a larger scale than the time reversal symmetry breaking one, stressing the importance of time reversal symmetry in the FTI phase stability. We also discuss possible fractional phases beyond \$\backslash nu = 1/2\$.},

@article{Weimer2010a,
abstract = {Following Feynman and as elaborated on by Lloyd, a universal quantum simulator (QS) is a controlled quantum device which reproduces the dynamics of any other many particle quantum system with short range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open system evolution. We investigate how laser excited Rydberg atoms in large spacing optical or magnetic lattices can provide an efficient implementation of a universal QS for spin models involving (high order) n-body interactions. This includes the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints such as the Kitaev toric code, color code, and lattice gauge theories with spin liquid phases. In addition, it provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The key basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates via auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step via optical pumping. This allows to mimic the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates.},

The role of the edge states in the quantized Hall conductance is discussed in the context of the general explanation of Laughlin. An extension of Laughlin's analysis is also used to investigate the existence of extended states in a weakly disordered two-dimensional system, when a strong magnetic field is present.},

Our calculation predicts a quantum phase transition from a gas to a solid phase when the density increases. In the gas phase, the condensate fraction is calculated as a function of the density. Using the Feynman approximation, the collective excitation branch is studied and the appearance of a roton minimum is observed. The results of the static structure factor at both sides of the gas-solid phase are also presented. The Lindemann ratio at the transition point becomes gamma=0.230(6). The condensate fraction in the gas phase is estimated as a function of the density.},

Edge states are shown to be robust against defect production, which highlights their topological nature.},

abstract = {We study a model of bosons in the lowest Landau level in a rotating trap where the confinement potential is a sum of a quadratic and a quartic term. The quartic term improves the stability of the system against centrifugal deconfinement and allows to consider rotation frequencies beyond the frequency of the quadratic part. The interactions between particles are modeled by a Dirac delta potential. We derive rigorously conditions for ground states of the system to be strongly correlated in the sense that they are confined to the kernel of the interaction operator, and thus contain the correlations of the Bose-Laughlin state. Rigorous angular momentum estimates and trial state arguments indicate a transition from a pure Laughlin state to a state containing in addition a giant vortex at the center of the trap (Laughlin quasi-hole). There are also indications of a second transition where the density changes from a flat profile in a disc or an annulus to a radial Gaussian confined to a thin annulus.},
