abstract = {The coupling of electrons to matter lies at the heart of our understanding of material properties such as electrical conductivity. Electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity. Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n = 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics.},

abstract = {We analyze a system of polar molecules in a one-dimensional optical lattice. By controlling the internal structure of the polar molecules with static electric and microwave fields, we demonstrate the appearance of a quantum phase transition into a ferroelectric phase via spontaneous breaking of a \$U(1)\$ symmetry. The phase diagram is first analyzed within mean-field theory, while in a second step the results are verified by a mapping onto the Bose-Hubbard model for hard-core bosons. The latter is studied within the well-established bosonization procedure. We find that the ferroelectric phase is characterized by (quasi) long-range order for the electric dipole moments.},

@article{Peter2013,
abstract = {A new method to drive a system of neutral dipolar fermions into the lowest Landau level regime is proposed. By employing adiabatic spin-flip processes in combination with a diabatic transfer, the fermions are pumped to higher orbital angular momentum states in a repeated scheme that allows for the precise control over the final angular momentum. A simple analytical model is derived to quantify the transfer and compare the approach to rapidly rotating systems. Numerical simulations of the transfer process have been performed for small, interacting systems.},

abstract = {We study the properties of spin systems realized by cold polar molecules interacting via dipole-dipole interactions in two dimensions. Using a spin wave theory, that allows for the full treatment of the characteristic long-distance tail of the dipolar interaction, we find several anomalous features in the ground state correlations and the spin wave excitation spectrum, which are absent in their counterparts with short range interaction. The most striking consequence is the existence of true long-range order at finite temperature for a two-dimensional phase with a broken U(1) symmetry.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the realization of topological band structures by exploiting the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of dipolar interactions in combination with broken time-reversal symmetry. The system is based on polar molecules trapped in a deep optical lattice, where the dynamics of rotational excitations follows a hopping Hamiltonian which is determined by the dipolar exchange interactions. We find topological bands with Chern number \$C=2\$ on the square lattice, while a very rich structure of different topological bands appears on the honeycomb lattice. We show that the system is robust against missing molecules. For certain parameters we obtain flat bands, providing a promising candidate for the realization of bosonic fractional Chern insulators.},
