The last few years would not have been as interesting and enjoyable as they were without the help and company of a lot of people.
I am very grateful to Hans Peter Büchler for a truly inspiring time and the chance to work on a lot of interesting projects.
I have learned a lot from you and have always enjoyed discussing physics with you.

I thank Tilman Pfau for being the first to raise my interest for this exciting field of physics.
